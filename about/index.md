I've been working with PHP, HTML, JS, and CSS since 2009.

I've a Technical Deploma in Computer Networks, and I'm at the final term at UoG to get my BSc in Computing.

I work basically with PHP (Laravel, WordPress), JavaScript, CSS (Twitter Bootstrap, Zurb Foundation, SASS/LESS), Grunt, and others web technologies and tools.

I work on Lenovo ThinkPad Edge E531 with Ubuntu and my favorite editor [Sublime Text 3](http://sublimetext.com/3).
