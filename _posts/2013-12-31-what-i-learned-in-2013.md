On 7 February from this year I start working for [Haykal Media](http://haykalmedia.com "Haykal Media") company (and still for now), I like the work here since you can do your job and have fun learning new stuff without restriction -since you're doing your job!-.

At Haykal Media I start working with [WordPress](http://wordpress.org "WordPress"), In the past I hoped to learn about WordPress but didn't get the motive, and here I've got motivated enough for that, I created many private plugins and themes for WordPress, and I'm happy to had that chance, the main project is [Aliqtisadi](http://aliqtisadi.com "Aliqtisadi Online") website, it has been updated several times this year.

In this year I dig into a lot of things in the free time or at home, like:

*   [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com "Grunt")
*   [Bower](http://bower.io "Bower")
*   [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com "Twitter Bootstrap")
*   [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com "Zurb Foundation")

And before finishing this year I deployed [new website](http://haykalmedia.com "Haykal Media") for our company, started it from scratch and used awesome tools to develop it (Twitter Bootstrap, Bower, Grunt, [jQuery](http://jquery.com "JQuery"), etc.). I'm proud of that website!

In the middle of this year I met Laravel, an amazing PHP Framework, I didn't has the chance to dive in it, but I hope to do so in this year if I have time, electricity and still alive :)

I'm on [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com "Ubuntu (operating system)"), using [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com "Sublime Text") with many useful [packages](https://gist.github.com/AAlakkad/5106627 "SublimeText useful packages").

My personal life changes in 2013:

*   Got engaged!
*   Displaced from my home.
*   Read [27](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4877040-ammar?read_at=2013) books

That's it..
