Hello there!

When I try to write technical posts in Wordpress I get depressed and let the whole idea goes!

Something sparks in my mind to use github as a blog, I searched and found [http://jekyllbootstrap.com/](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/)!

And you're looking at the static blog built using Jekyll based on Jekyll Bootstrap.
